### Final project

This project is based on a mapping project I undertook for the Geography 469
course, GIS Workshop. We used QGIS and digital elevation models to
display the extent of various sized floods in the Carnation area of the Snoqualmie
river. I wanted to make a web map displaying these maps so they could be easily
accessible to the public. The blue polygons represent the extent of the water.
